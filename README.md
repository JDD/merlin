#Merlin DB Updates
In case people feel a desperate need to live on the bleeding edge, I'll sometimes include links here to  python/SQL to update the database when the bot requires it. This will come with very little support, and the recommendation is to *stay on the stable branches*.

That said, [here](https://github.com/d7415/merlin/tree/db-updates) they are.
